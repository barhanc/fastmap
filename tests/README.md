This is an exemplar map of elections with 8 candidates and 96 voters which requires computing 46056
distances that was generated using the AA heuristic in about 1 minute on Intel Core i9-12900K CPU or
about 7 minutes on Apple M1. The reproducible (NOTE: there is some problem with `seed` parameter for
`"norm-mallows"` culture in Mapel library which makes absolute reproducibility not possible right
now) code is in [minimap.py](/tests/minimap.py) file.
